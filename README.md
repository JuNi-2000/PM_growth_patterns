# PM_growth_patterns
Masters project investigating pleural mesothelioma growth patterns

Project includes differential gene expression between solid and non-solid growth patterns in pleural mesothelioma.
Further, the tumour microenvironment is deconvoluted (Benchmarking section is included to find best algorithm). 
Lastly, the project investigates spatial imaging data from MacSima to confirm changes in gene expression in the TME.
